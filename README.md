# p1e1-recipe-markup

## Introduction

This is the first exercise in a project arc to create an online recipe book. Over the course of the project arc, we will practice how to markup content with meaningful (semantic) HTML, adding images and links, create design with CSS, and link our recipe pages together into a website.

## Instructions

### Preparation

+ Create an IMS222 folder for all your coding projects
+ Download this project's starter packs containing the text of the recipes and images for each recipe.
  + recipesproject-main.zip
+ Expand zip file and move folder to your IMS projects folder
+ Change "main" in the folder name to your MU ID. For example...
  + recipesproject-yarnete
+ In Brackets, go to the file menu and "Open Folder" and select this folder.
+ In the left column, you'll now see all of these files.

### Markup Your Content
For each of the recipes....
+ Copy the <head> section from the sample and paste it  
+ Referring to our HTML syntax and basic elements pages in Module 3
+ Start with the headers.
  + Create an H1 header for title of the recipe. (This is your page title)
  + Create H2 headers for your page sections such as recipe history, ingredients, and instructions.
Mark up your recipe information paragraphs.
Turn your recipe ingredients into an unordered list (bulleted).
List the instruction steps using an ordered list (numbered).
Add Image and Give Credit 
Above your `<h1>`, add your image. Don't forget to include the alt= attribute in your image element.
Create a paragraph with links to where you found your recipe, history, and image.  This is citing your sources. 
Last, but not least, give yourself credit in a final paragraph.
Submission method and due date

When completed, use this assignment submission to upload your .html file.

Version 1.0 Deadline:  Sunday, 8 February 2021 by midnight (your local time). 
Grading

This is a 10 point exercise.

Grading-wise, this is grading by checklist as opposed to my judgement call on quality. If you include the required content and the HTML is perfect, you get full points.

Essentially each item above is 1 to 3 points. For example, the image is 3 points because you need the tag, the image source, and the alt text. Each list is two points — one for the line items, then another for properly setting it up as an ordered or unordered list.

In your grading feedback, I'll give tips on how to fix errors. Version 1.1 resubmit will be due a couple days after I finish grading.
