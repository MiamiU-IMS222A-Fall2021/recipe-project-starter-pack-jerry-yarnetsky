        Easy Ratatouille

        Ratatouille is a traditionally French dish originating from the province of Nice. It is a stewed vegetable dish consisting of tomatoes, eggplant, onions, garlic, zucchini, peppers, and usually some type of leafy greens like spinach. The word ratatouille comes from the Occitan word ratatouille, meaning “to stir up”. Since the late 1700s, this dish was generally a “course stew,” but has evolved to become a layered vegetable dish.
